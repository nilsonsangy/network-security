# network-security

Useful scripts and tools for network security.

## AD_security_audit.ps1

This script performs an Active Directory (AD) security audit. It checks for common misconfigurations, weak permissions, and other vulnerabilities in an AD environment. The script generates a detailed report that can be used to improve the security posture of the AD infrastructure.

## Just_Enough_Administration.ps1

This script implements Just Enough Administration (JEA) - a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) principle through PowerShell Remoting. It allows administrators to delegate specific administrative tasks without granting full administrative privileges, reducing the risk of accidental or malicious changes to the system.
