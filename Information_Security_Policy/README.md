## General Standards

### Management of IT Environment Equipment

#### Network Environment

The computer network consists of the medium for traffic, storage, and execution of applications and systems within the business of Financeira XPTO. This medium is protected by security levels and managed by the IT Superintendency.

The network environment is composed of data servers, physical data traffic means, workstations, and management tools of this infrastructure. Any changes in the configuration of network hardware and software (including computers and accessories) must be preceded by an evaluation of the Change Management, Risk Management, and Information Security processes.

Network cables and connectors must be installed and maintained by qualified technicians to ensure their integrity and functionality and must be tested beforehand (upon installation) to ensure connection between the equipment.  
Any unused network point must be identified, disabled, and formally documented.

#### Documentation

The documentation of all equipment involved in the IT environment must be kept updated and available to responsible and authorized personnel to ensure their proper functioning.  
- **Inventory**: a formal inventory of all equipment and product use licenses must be controlled and kept up to date.  
- **Equipment failures**: all equipment failures must be promptly communicated and recorded in a failure reporting system. The root causes of these incidents must be analyzed and addressed to prevent recurrence.

### Data Communication

#### Private Data Communication Channels

Due to the distance between data processing sites and system operation sites, Financeira XPTO's business fundamentally depends on communication channels. To ensure the continuity of its business, based on the operation of business systems, Financeira XPTO must maintain redundant (backup) data communication channels. The capacity and speed must be compatible with Financeira XPTO's needs to ensure good operational performance. The main and backup communication channels must be contracted from different providers and must never overlap.

### Workstation Configuration and Software Inventory

User workstations in the IT environment must comply with the standard described in standard IN0032 Standard Workstation, established by the IT Superintendency responsible for configuring equipment, available software, and for registering users and assigning access permissions to the network:  
- Standard workstations must have a centralized system to control input/output (I/O) interfaces, e.g., diskettes, CD, DVD, PEN-DRIVE, etc.;  
- Basic software, applications, and any type of software will be installed with the consent of the IT Superintendency, which will maintain continuous inventory and license control;  
- Workstations may be audited randomly and without prior notice to identify software copyright piracy;  
- Personal work such as spreadsheets and text documents considered sensitive to loss must be stored in a predefined area on the network environment to be included in backup processes.

The installation of software by direct download from the Internet is strictly prohibited, except in the case of contracted suppliers who make their software available for download. Express authorization from the Infrastructure and IT Support and Information Security departments is required.

Any failure in the use of software, whether basic or application, must be promptly reported and recorded in a failure logging system.

### Confidentiality and Privacy in the Use of Information

Information processing resources are provided for business purposes. Improper or unauthorized use constitutes a violation of the established rules and may result in disciplinary action.

#### Use and Disposal of Printed Reports

Information classified as confidential should never be printed on a network printer (shared printer for general user use) without the issuer or an authorized person safeguarding its confidentiality during and after printing.

Any printed report containing confidential information must be destroyed immediately after use to prevent access by unauthorized individuals. When it is necessary to archive or keep it for continued work the following day, the report must never be left on the desk or in a drawer that does not guarantee its security, as addressed in standard "IN0192 Physical Security and Protection."

#### Use and Disposal of Removable Storage Media (CDs, DVDs, and PEN-DRIVES)

Only personnel authorized to install or modify software may use removable media to transfer data to/from Financeira XPTO's network. Preferably, this activity should be restricted to the technical support area and/or network administrators.

Confidential information no longer needed and stored on magnetic media must be deleted before disposal.

#### Use of Mobile and Portable Devices (notebooks, phones, smartphones, PDAs, tablets, etc.)

The use of mobile devices must always be authorized in accordance with the recommendations of IN0011 Use of Mobile Devices at Financeira XPTO.

Users must accept the terms and conditions of use and, in particular, take responsibility for the security of the information contained in their data storage units.

## Information Protection Against Fire and Other Risks

All information assets must be protected against fire risk at all times. The level of protection must reflect the risk and the value of the information contained in the asset.

# Internet Access

Internet access, as defined in standard "IN2009 Use of Internet Access," is configured in the requesting user's network profile. This access is personal and non-transferable, and the user is responsible for the resource and any actions resulting from its misuse or sharing.

The access request must be formally made by the user and approved by their immediate manager.

This resource is provided by Financeira XPTO considering the benefits it offers in supporting work activities. However, it is the responsibility of the IT Infrastructure and Support Management to monitor its proper use, due to factors such as:

- Internet access can serve as an entry point to the network, exposing it to attacks by viruses, worms, spam, phishing scams, and entities aiming to illicitly manipulate Financeira XPTO's intellectual property or harm its information;
- Access to Internet website content must be controlled through specific content analysis software, allowing primarily sites related to Financeira XPTO's business activities;
- Downloading files from the Internet must be restricted to authorized user groups and controlled by content analysis software, and must also be scanned and protected against viruses;
- Financeira XPTO reserves the right to monitor Internet use on its network-connected workstations using analysis and protection tools.

## Data Encryption

Encryption is a method used to modify the original text of a message to be transmitted, generating an unintelligible text at the origin, through a coding process defined by the encryption method.

Considering Financeira XPTO's business, where operational information is extremely sensitive, maintaining a data encryption process through appropriate software is essential to its systems. All data transmissions must adopt encryption for sensitive data, according to standards "IN8202 Logical Security" and "IN2013 Critical System Access Security."

Whenever possible, all transmissions of sensitive or confidential data should be encrypted and authenticated using digital certificates.

### Access Key and Password

Users of information assets may only access them using access keys authenticated by secret passwords known only to them, as established in standard IN3382 Logical Security.

### Logical Access Control

#### Computer Network Access Control

The definition of user profiles for access to the Corporate Network (IN0082 Logical Security) shall be the responsibility of the Information Security area, as well as establishing basic access profiles by position or function, reviewed and approved by the managers and information owner.

All accesses must be logged in protected log files and monitored in order to identify potential misuse of systems or information.

The standard IN1413 Critical Systems Access Security specifies the requirements for access to systems.

All users must follow the approved "login" procedures to access equipment, and whenever they leave their workstation, they must lock it or perform a "logoff" procedure.

The execution of commands in the operating system of servers will be restricted to persons duly authorized to perform administration and control functions of these systems. The operational rules for access control are defined in the standard IN3382 Logical Security.

#### Application Systems Access Control

Accesses must be logged, and for systems with critical transactions, they must be monitored to identify potential misuse of systems or information.  
The standards IN-SG014-2013 - Critical Systems Access Security and IN2238 Logical Security specify the requirements for access to network and systems.

### Physical Access Control

#### IT Environment

IT equipment must be in a protected environment to ensure its optimal operation and prevent access by unauthorized persons, as established in the standard "IN0602 Physical Access to XPTO Financial Institution Facilities".  
The server room (Datacenter) is the technological core of the company. This location must be restricted only to the previously authorized maintenance team. Access to this environment must be controlled using strong identification and authentication techniques with specific devices such as closed-circuit TV monitoring, uninterrupted internal and external sensing against unauthorized access attempts, as specified in the standard "IN0062 Physical Access to XPTO Financial Institution Facilities".

## Access for Service Providers

When there is a business need for access by service providers, a prior agreement must be made through a signed contract. The contract must clearly establish the rules and conditions for access permissions of their representatives and the confidentiality of created or accessed information, to avoid misunderstandings between XPTO Financial Institution and its service providers, as outlined in the standard "IN8062 Physical Access to XPTO Financial Institution Facilities".

No service provider may enter any premises without following these rules:

- Use of identification badges;
- Registration of the visitor or service provider, including personal data, reason for the visit, company they work for, employee visited or person authorizing the visit, and date and time of entry and exit;
- Accompaniment by an employee of the area, already inside the facility.

## Network Intrusion Protection

Equipment, operating systems and applications, network and communication systems will be properly configured and protected against physical access and unauthorized network access, as established in the standard "IN9982 - Logical Security".  
It is the responsibility of the IT Infrastructure and Support Management to protect the corporate network of XPTO Financial Institution against internal and external unauthorized user intrusions, to protect the data assets, equipment, and the reputation of XPTO. Computer network protection must address attack types such as:

- Unauthorized access;
- Denial of service;
- Information theft;
- Service unavailability.

To protect against network intrusion, necessary actions must be taken to minimize risks and impacts to information security, according to the standard IN2002 Logical Security.

### Backup Execution

Backups of files stored in the network environment will be carried out by network operators (IN8202 Logical Security) and must be stored in a safe location, geographically distant from the originals whenever possible, for the period determined by the applicable civil and tax legislation, when applicable.  
Periodic restoration tests of backup copies must be performed, implying media replacement when necessary.

### Software Library Control

Software in general must be protected and stored in specific libraries for development/homologation and production environments.  
Updates to program libraries, especially production libraries, must be carried out by a "librarian" authorized by the IT Infrastructure and Support Management, following the procedures described in the standard IN1201 Change Management.

Application systems must be made available to users only after validation tests by the requesters and end users, duly approved and accepted in the homologation environment.

Whenever there is a software version update, previous versions must be retained as a contingency measure, clearly and formally identified, with the replacement date and the period the program was in production.

Test data must be protected and controlled. System and acceptance tests require substantial volumes of data and should closely reflect the data in production. However, when the production database is made available for testing, it must be de-characterized before use.

To reduce the potential risk of software failures, access control to source program libraries must be established, covering both the test and production environments.  
The distribution of source programs for maintenance by programmers and analysts must only be carried out by the person responsible for maintaining the library and with authorization from the manager authorized by the Information Technology Superintendency.

### Physical Sites for Contingency Operation

XPTO Financial Institution must maintain physically distant and redundant environments to ensure the restoration of production operations within a timeframe acceptable to the business, as outlined in IN2011 SGCN Manual.

Development and production environments must also be segregated from the corporate network.

### Audits
